# JS Currency Convertor

Simple tool to provide poor-mans-multi-currency support to a web app.  Assumes you will be billing in a fixed currency, and want to provide estimated costs in a users native currency.

## TODO

- Async request to get rates
- Cookies
- Geolocation / IP location lookups?
- Add a suffix to converted costs, to denote that a converted cost is an estimate
